	/* We have to observe primarily two things i.e what is a scatter-plot and what is its use ?
	 > Scatter plot is a type of mathematical diagram used to display
	 values for two variables for a set of data
	 > Let us relate that to our Analysis of the Results.We have two 
	 variables to represent data , one is the SGPA and other is the
	 Grade associated with the SGPA. 
	 > If we go deeper we can understand that this can be used to plot
	 a graph for all the records(Students) in a Class with respect to 
	 their Subjects.
	 > We will take :
	  -> On X Axis - Grades
	  -> On Y Axis - SGPA
	  -> Set Comparison - Subjects (5 on an average)
