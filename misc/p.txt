Over the past few years, JavaScript has been used more and more as a server-side computer programming language owing to platforms such as Node.js and SpiderMonkey.Now that JavaScript programming is moving out of the browser, programmers will find they need to use many of the tools provided by more conventional languages, such as C++ and Java. Among these tools are classic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and graphs, as well as classic algorithms for sorting and searching data. This book discusses how to implement these data structures and algorithms for server-side JavaScript programming.
