## ES6 (ECMAScript 6)

This is a sub-directory of my Playground which shall contain Examples, short snippets, concepts and best practices of ECMA Script 6. They are fun to learn and implement.

### Things that are covered

+ `Block Scoped Functions`
+ `Block Scoping`
+ `do Expressions`
+ `Classes`
+ `Async functions`
+ `Arrow Functions`

`NOTE` : Although there are a lot of unmentioned features of ES6 MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) docs have all the required things under them.

### What new concepts will be covered here ?

I agree the fact that one can learn ES6 core concepts and functionalities with the helpof internet, but most of the docs/examples/snippets which you observe are related to functional programming. So this can be considered as functional programming with ES6.

### Style

Unlike the `Feross` style used by many `javascript` programmers i prefer a blend of his with my own tweaks, so there isn't any particular style which i will follow. So to all those `nazis` I'm sorry in advance.

### Issues

If there are any mistakes please raise an issue, I am happy to accept a PR.
