This is Just an animation based on a Javascript Library 
=======================================================
The demonstration was part of the Hour of code but i have 
manipulated it such that we can have a user input to the 
name and colour.

Libraries Used:
==============
 > alphabet.js
 > Bubbles.js

Reminder:
========
We cannot import the Bubbles.js as it doesnot allow the 
users to import it's library.
